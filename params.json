It has a simple and direct syntax so that you can easily write tests to increase the quality of your mods.\r\n\r\nIt is inspired by [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io) for Javascript. It is currently available for **Fallout 4** and **[Skyrim](https://github.com/chesko256/Lilac)**.\r\n\r\nLilac can be built into your mod and distributed with it. Your tests will only run when you decide to run them; your users will most likely never know they exist.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nDocumentation can be found on the Lilac GitHub Wiki: https://github.com/chesko256/LilacFO4/wiki\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\nLilac does not have any extra requirements for Fallout 4.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nAll of Lilac is contained in a single script file, **Lilac.psc**. There is no complex set-up or installation.\r\n\r\nDownload and install the [latest release](https://github.com/chesko256/LilacFO4/releases) using a mod manager, or just drop Lilac.psc into your `Scripts/Source` directory. Then, create a new script that extends Lilac and away you go:\r\n\r\n    scriptname MyTests extends Lilac\r\n\r\n### Writing Tests\r\nLilac allows you to write tests in a clear and expressive syntax.\r\n\r\n    function MonsterSpawnerSuite()\r\n\r\n        it ( \"should spawn monsters\", MonsterSpawnerTest() )\r\n\r\n    endFunction\r\n\r\n\r\n    function MonsterSpawnerTest()\r\n\r\n        spawner.SpawnMonsters()\r\n        expect ( spawner.SpawnedMonsterCount, to, beEqualTo, 20 )\r\n        expect ( spawner.LastSpawnedMonster, notTo, beNone )\r\n        expect ( spawner.LastSpawnedMonsterType, to, beEqualTo, MegaDragon )\r\n\r\n    endFunction\r\n\r\n### Running Tests\r\nLilac test scripts are attached to quests. To run your tests, just start the quest:\r\n    \r\n    startquest MyTestQuest\r\n\r\nThe results will be printed to your Papyrus log.\r\n\r\n### Version History\r\n\r\nv1.2: Initial Fallout 4 version.\r\n\r\n### License\r\nLilac is released under the [MIT License](https://github.com/chesko256/LilacFO4/blob/master/MIT.LICENSE).\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nContact Chesko at chesko.tesmod@gmail.com\r\n",
